# SQL-TO-FORM-JS

### <strong>sql-to-form-js</strong> is a js library to create HTML forms, complete with validations, from SQL queries.

#

> It is mainly designed for back-end developers, who want to create quick forms to test their back-end code.

> Since it uses SQL syntax, developers do not have to learn anything new.

> It uses my nativeValidatejs library for form validation, so there is no third-party dependencies involved.

> Everything is written natively, so it runs fast, without any bulkness from unnecessary packages.
